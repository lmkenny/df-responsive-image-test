          Every design sends a message. When you get the message right for your tribe, they can’t help but be drawn to it and your laser focussed signal separates from the noise.

          “The team at DemingFactor took real care for our issue and created many wonderful designs, from the posters, to the tote bags to the shop front stickers and laptop stickers, we loved the work they produced and would well recommend them”
          — Lucy Chan, Founder SuperMarketFree Month

          Most people don’t care about how awesome your product is, they care about how awesome they are when they use it.

          “I called on the them at DemingFactor to help us redevelop our app from something people used to a tool people raved about.
          We appreciated their amazing design work as well as their ability to convert their designs directly into code. Having a friendly design team that could produce production grade CSS and integrate with our git workflow was a godsend.” — Adam Davies, Head of Development
